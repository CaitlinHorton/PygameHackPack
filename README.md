# PygameHackPack
There are two folders on this git reposetory
The first one is a mini car game where the player must avoid oncomming traffic. The code focuses on allowing for the screen size to change and for the game to still be aligned properly, and it also works with using images in a pygame window.
The second one is for a basic user interface with buttons, an output area that you can scroll with as well as the ability for the user to insert their own image
